Data views
You create a data view by defining the target namespace, the source stream or streams, the desired data fields, time period, and interpolation interval. The ability to create data views in the portal will mesh directly with OSIsoft's Data Science Enablement efforts, whereby users will be able to programmatically access Data View content via an API for the purposes of advanced analytics.

To create a new data view, complete the following:
1. Click Add Data View in the Data Views pane.
2. Enter the data view Name and Description in the Data View Information pane.
3. Click Standard or Narrow to specify the general shape of the data display.
4. Click the Add Query button in the Query Explorer pane.
5. In the Query ID pane, enter a name for the query in the Query ID field, or accept the default name. 
6. In the Query Type area, select Streams or Assets to indicate which this query is intended to search.
7. Type a portion of the name of any known stream or asset (preceded/followed by the * wildcard symbol)
