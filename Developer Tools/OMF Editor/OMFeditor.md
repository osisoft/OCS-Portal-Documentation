# OMF editor

The Open Message Format (OMF) defines a set of message headers and message bodies. Messages are written in JSON and are used to generate compliant messages for data ingress. The OMF specification is generic in that it does not specify a particular back-end system. For OSIsoft Cloud Services, OMF can be used to create types, create streams, and populate streams with data. There are three message formats that can be used to accomplish these tasks: type messages, container messages, and data messages. The OMF Editor helps build and validate OMF messages to be ingested by the OCS Data Store.

You can edit and then utilize the following options for each message format provided:

* Click **Copy OMF** to copy message content to your clipboard.
  
* Click **Download OMF** to download message content to your local drive.

* Click **Reset Template** to delete any changes you have made to message content.
  
* Click **Format OMF** to reset template content alignment after making changes.
